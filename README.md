### Hi there 👋

I am currently working as an iOS Software Engineer.

#### 🔭 Open-source Work

This is my personal GitHub repo. Here you can find apps and libraries I've developed in my spare time. The main goal is to try new technologies, practices and tools and learn with those experiences.

#### 🌱 Learning

I'm always trying to learn more about Swift and iOS 🍎

#### 👯 Collaboration

Happy to collaborate on exciting OSS projects. My main focus is Swift (language and related projects) and Functional Programming.

#### ⚡ Fun fact

Not properly a fun fact but I've started running more seriously in 2019 (when I did my first 10Km race) 🏃‍♂️. In 2020 I booked my first Ultra Trail 50Km (unfortunatelly postponed to 2021). More to come in 2021 ⛰
